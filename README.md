The pipeline for building & publishing your Flutter app for different target platforms.

## Features

#### General
- Specify platforms, build commands, and your preferences in `pubspec.yaml`
- Logs the output of all build & publish commands for future reviews
- Define multiple workflows for different build, environment, etc.

#### iOS & macOS
- Publishing the iOS app to App Store
- Optional clearing of XCode's derived data for consistent builds

#### Android
- Publishing the Android app to the Play Store

#### Web
- Adds the version query paramter to build files post-build to solve the caching problem of Flutter web (e.g. `flutter_bootstrap.js?v=0.12.1`)


## Usage
Once the configuration is added to your project, you can run the desired command via:

```bash
# To build for all given platforms in the default workflow
dart run build_pipe:build

# To build for all given platforms in a named workflow
dart run build_pipe:build --workflow=your_workflow_name

# The build command will funnel all other args passed (e.g., --dart-define) to the build
# commands on all platforms
# This allows github actions etc to pass environment vars down to the build cmd without editing the yaml file
# The build command, as of now, does not have any args or flags of its own
dart run build_pipe:build --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=prod

# To publish the built app to the given platforms
dart run build_pipe:publish
```

Read the topics below to setup and configure your project. The configuration is quite simple, and you just need to do it once.

#### Filtering Target Platforms

By default, `build_pipe` builds all platforms defined in the selected workflow. If you need to build only specific platforms, you can use the `--targets` flag:

```bash
# Build only Android
dart run build_pipe:build --targets=android

# Build multiple platforms (comma-separated)
dart run build_pipe:build --targets=android,ios,web
```
